####Project Inspiration
I developed this app with Kevin Chang (Github - laskdaf) for the Friends of Children with Special Needs(FCSN) organization. 

####App description:
This app features two modes: free play and song-follow.

During free play, pressing down on any of the music keys causes the note to be played.
During song-follow mode, the user will need to press down on the key that is highlighted. If they key needs to be pressed multiple times, the key will flash the same color.  

####App features:
Here are the songs that are built into the app:
  -Twinkle Twinkle Little Star
  -Old McDonald
  -I Love You (Barney version)
  -C Major Scale
  -Happy Birthday
  
Built in tempo - user has the option to select what tempo they want the song to be played at. 

Project completion date: 7/31/16
